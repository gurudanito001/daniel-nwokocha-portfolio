This is the story about how I became a developer and my web development journey.

It was 2012, I was in my final year in secondary school. A time when everyone seemed to have a clear picture of how they would spend their next five years in the university. Everyone except me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have always liked education, I just didn&#39;t like school, if that makes any sense. The Nigerian education system seemed to me like a lottery. You gamble five or more years of your life and hope to join the queue of over 25 million graduates and get a job instantly. The quality of education available in nigerian universities hardly prepares graduates for real life challenges. I didn&#39;t want to join the queue. I wanted to do something I loved instead. I just didn&#39;t know what.

##### **First Contact with programming**

At this time, I happened to have an uncle who just came from the university. He hadn&#39;t fully completed his university education, yet he had several job offers. I was curious. How did he do it? What does he do? What did he learn? He told me that he studied computer science in the university, but he also told me of how he had to skip several classes and courses which taught outdated and impractical knowledge so he could learn how to code. I never knew what coding was. It was the closest thing to sorcery I had ever witnessed. I loved it.

##### **My Coding Journey Begins**

My parents soon learned of my interest in programming and were happy to fund my training in a web development institute. My excitement was sky-high as I enrolled and joined in the first weeks but it soon disappeared as I met serious challenges. The lectures presumed that students had some knowledge of computers and programming which I didn&#39;t have. The lectures tried to teach a lot within a period of six months which made it difficult for me to understand. I was struggling and eventually gave way to doubt. Maybe this is not for me after all.
 After the course ended, I began to practice the little I was able to learn from the course. For the next few months, programming was mostly about changing the background color of a webpage to red to show my friends how much of a genius I was. I soon realized the need to expand my knowledge of programming. This was probably because my *&quot;background-color: red;&quot;* trick was getting old and I needed to learn something new to keep my genius status.
 I discovered how much information I could learn from the internet. I downloaded books and videos resources. There was so much to learn so I got cracking. I read as many resources as i could find and after a year of self learning, I was confident enough to apply for a job. I interviewed for a small company that built websites and I got the job. It was a wonderful opportunity to build a tech career. The challenge I had then was that most of the web design work was done with Wordpress templates and very little coding. It was my first contact with wordpress and I soon began to get the hang of it. I worked there for about 8 months and had to leave for financial reasons. I got another job in another wordpress development company which only lasted a month.

I spent the next couple of months at home without a job. It was getting frustrating. Then one day my parents told me that a family friend owned a programming company and asked if I would like to reach out to him.

##### **My Big Break**

 I submitted a resume at iDevWorks the owners of SMSLIVE247 and was eventually employed as an intern into the company. We were two interns in the software development department and we began our training immediately. At that time, I was familiar with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a little of JavaScript. But I had to start the learning curve all over again. HTML5, Css3 and Bootstrap4.Two months into my employment, the software department had a big project. The CEO tasked us to rewrite the current SMSLIVE247 software, make it responsive and mobile friendly. The head of the department knew he needed all the help he could get even the help of interns. So I was conscripted to work on a very big project just two months into my internship. This project was a turning point in my programming career. Over the next two years in iDevWorks I honed my skills in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap4, Javascript and React. iDevWorks specialized in .NET so although I was majorly the Frontend UI / UX developer, I built a handful of APIs with C# and .NET core 3.1. During my final months in iDevWorks, I began to delve into NodeJs. I eventually built a few projects with the MERN stack and became a Full Stack JavaScript developer. I got my feet wet with some other technologies like React Native and Typescript. After two years in iDevWorks, I decided it was time to go. I got a Job in Agro Nigeria - An Agriculture news media firm - which is where I work currently.

This is not yet a happy ending story, but the Journey has been eventful. I am really grateful to everyone who has contributed to my progress in my career. It is because of all of you that I am so determined to succeed in my career as a programmer. This will also be the first article I will be writing in my blog. I hope it is the first of many to come.
